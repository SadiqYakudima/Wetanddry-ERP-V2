The Brief (Structured Requirements):
1. Inventory Module: Multi-Unit Tracking
Requirement: The system currently tracks cement in silos. We must now extend tracking to cement stored in containers as well.
Technical Need: Create a storage type definition (Silo vs. Container) and ensure stock levels can be queried independently by storage medium.
2. CRM & Finance: Project Prepayments
Requirement: The CRM must allow clients to make prepayments specifically tied to projects (Deposit/Wallet functionality).
Technical Need: Logic to handle "Unearned Revenue" or client credit balances that can be drawn down as orders are fulfilled.
3. Production Management: Batch Variance & Rescheduling
Requirement: For every production batch, we must track Pre-production input (Planned) vs. Post-production input (Actual).
Requirement: The system must handle logic for "Delays" or "Rescheduling," likely requiring a status workflow update to account for inventory committed but not yet used due to delay.
4. Sales & Finance: Payment Schedules & Order Logic
Requirement: Support for Scheduled Payments (Installments) and Pending Orders.
Technical Need: Define the logic/validation rules required to move an order from "Pending" to "Active" (e.g., specific payment threshold met).
5. Procurement & Costing: Input Price Fluctuation
Requirement: The system must track price changes for raw material inputs over time.
Technical Need: Implement historical pricing logs or Weighted Average Cost (WAC) tracking to ensure production costs reflect the actual price of materials at the time of use, not just current market price.
6. Inventory Control: Stock Reconciliation
Requirement: A feature for manual inventory adjustment following monthly physical verification (specifically mentioned for Silo levels).
Technical Need: An "Adjustment Wizard" that allows authorized users to overwrite system stock figures with physical count figures, automatically posting the variance to a "Loss/Gain" account.
